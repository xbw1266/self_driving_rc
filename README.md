# self_driving_rc
This is a project that builds a self-driving Remote control car. The frame of the car was 3D printed and built from scratch. 
Until now, the car has the ability to drive itself within the lane, stop at the stop sign, comply with the traffic light (green light and red light), and SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) using the RPLidar onboard.
